<p>You are invited to participate in a research study entitled "Investigating factors that play a role in interaction between manually driven and automated vehicles". The study is being conducted by Ruolin Gao (PhD candidate), prof. dr. Marieke H. Martens, dr. Pavlo Bazilinskyy, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, <a href="mailto:r.gao@tue.nl" target="_blank">r.gao@tue.nl</a>.</p>

<p>You may of course always contact Ruolin Gao via r.gao@tue.nl, if you have any questions, or you can discuss this information with people you know. You must be at least 18 years old to participate. During this study you will watch videos about traffic scenarios and rate the experiences produced by the scenarios from a driverâ€™s view. Your eye movements will be tracked via your webcam, and from that infers where you are looking on the screen. There will also be a test exercise to calibrate the eye tracker to you and your viewing position before tracking can begin on your display. The exercise simply involves sitting in position and visually following a dot appearing at different places on the screen for a short period of time. We will NOT use the camera to observe or log anything else than your eye movements since for this study this is important for us to know. You will NOT be monitored via the camera on anything else than your eye movements and we will not record any video. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes of your time.  </p>
